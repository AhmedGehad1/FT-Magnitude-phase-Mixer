## How to use My application ?

### The Application is very simple to use and here's the steps:
* **Runing The Application**
  Open visual studio code and run main.py

* **Loading Photos** 
	From file, you choose upload. Directly, a window appears on your screen, you can choose the photo you want.
	But remeber the two photos must be the same size or you will have an error message.
  #### Both Images must be of the same size

* **Showing Components**

  * **Mixing Photos**
	Final step and the main goal of our application, mixing photos. You simply can choose the images you want to mix.
	You should choose the first component then choose the second component you want to mix with. 
	There are sliders if you want to change the ratios between the two photos.
	You also have two displays you can choose which one to display onto.
